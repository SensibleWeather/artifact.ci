# Data Retention

artifact.ci is intended only as a temporary storage for the sake of viewing artifacts - the source of truth is GitHub. So, when you view an artifact, is it pulled from GitHub and uploaded to our storage service (supabase). But stored files will be periodically deleted from Supabase. Old artifacts can still be viewed, but they will need to be pulled from GitHub and uploaded again (this process is automatic, it usually just means waiting a few seconds to view your artifact again).

This cleanup happen regularly, but no files newer than 24 hours old will be cleaned up. If you need a retention policy shorter than 24 hours, please get in touch.

Metadata is store in the database, and is *not* deleted automatically. This metadata includes:

- Repository name and owner
- Commit SHAs
- Branch names
- GitHub Actions run IDs
- Artifact names
- Artifact file *names* (content is not stored in the database/not retained)

This metadata is used to identify and retrieve artifacts that do not (yet) exist in the storage service.

If you want to delete this metadata, you can email contact@artifact.ci.
